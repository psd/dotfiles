There are many ways to setup Unix, this is mine.

## bash

I may use [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)), but I'll always be thinking of [KornShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell).

## neovim

I've used [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_(text_editor)) solidly since 1986, when it was a big jump from [ed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(software)). I felt a similar advance recently after switching to [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). 
The [LSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol) integration is particularly magical.

## stow

I maintain this repo using [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) thanks to this [blog post](https://medium.com/quick-programming/managing-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow-9b04c155ebad).
